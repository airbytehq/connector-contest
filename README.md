## Prizes

**For every connector created, you will receive $500 USD.**

Additionally, there will be monthly MVPs that will receive swag and an additional cash prize based on contribution amount.

There is no limit on how many connectors one individual can submit, but teams that submit a connector will only receive one prize per connector. You can only work on one connector issue at a time. To clarify, you will be paid $500 for each accepted entry!

* Must follow the [checklist](https://github.com/airbytehq/connector-contest/blob/main/GUIDELINES.md#connector-checklist) for all requirements.
* Must have proper documentation for Getting Started and usage.
* Must include a sandbox account for integration tests.

## Restrictions
Certain connectors may be restricted from this contest based on their already in-progress work or in-house requirements that need to be fulfilled. Make sure to get affirmation or acknowledgement before starting work on a connector for the contest.
